SRCL is an open-source React component and style repository that helps you build web applications, desktop applications, and static websites with terminal aesthetics. Its modular, easy-to-use components emphasize precise monospace character spacing and line heights, enabling you to quickly copy and paste implementations while maintaining a clean, efficient codebase.
